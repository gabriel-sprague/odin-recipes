        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Smoking the perfect salmon shouldn't be a chore. That's why I've found the perfect recipe for all your fishy needs. Please note, you will need a <em>charcoal</em> grill for this recipe (and wood chips to go with it).</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>2-4 lb salmon fillet (w/ skin on & bones removed)</li>
            <li>2 Cups alder or applewood or cherry smoking chips (smoked in water of charcoal)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps to Success</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Create the dry brine by mixing the sugar and salt together in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Place the salmon filet skin-side down on a wire rack on top of a rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle the brine mixture over the entire filet to coat. Place in the refrigerator uncovered for 1 hour to 2 hours before smoking.</li>
            <li>Set up your smoker for indirect cooking with a water bath drip pan in place, and preheat according to the manufacturer's instructions to 225&deg;F.</li>
            <li>While the smoker heats up, remove the salmon from the refrigerator and dry off any excess moisture with paper towels.</li>
            <li>When the smoker starts smoking and reaches 225&deg; F, place the salmon skin-side down on a sheet of foil and transfer to the smoker.</li>
            <li>The salmon is finished smoking when the internal temperature reaches 140&deg; F. Begin checking for doneness after 30 minutes using a probe thermometer.</li>
            <li>Remove from the smoker and rest for 5 minutes before serving, or cover and chill in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.</li>
        </ol>
