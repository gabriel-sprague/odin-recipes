        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Everyone loves the perfect breakfast (or dinner) of pancakes. With a slight blueberry twist, you'll be on the road to a full stomach and a happy body in no time!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup (227g) milk</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons Pure Vanilla Extract, optional</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons (43g) melted butter or 3 tablespoons (35g) vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups (180g) All purpose flour</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons (25g) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 cup (85g) blueberries, fresh or frozen</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps to Success</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a griddle to 350&deg;F. If you don't have a griddle, heat a large frying pan over medium-low to medium heat. Grease the griddle. When it's hot enough, a drop of water will skitter across the surface, evaporating immediately.</li>
            <li>Beat the eggs, milk, and vanilla until light and foamy, about 3 minutes at high speed of a stand or hand mixer. Stir in the melted butter or oil.</li>
            <li>Add the flour, salt, baking powder, and sugar, stirring just to combine. A few lumps are OK. Set the batter aside to rest for a couple of minutes; it'll thicken a bit as it stands. Thin the batter with additional milk if it's not pourable consistency.</li>
            <li>Drop the batter by 1/4 cupfuls onto the prepared griddle or pan; a muffin scoop works well here. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon berries atop each pancake.</li>
            <li>Cook the cakes till they're golden brown on the bottom, about 2 minutes. Flip them over, and cook till the other side is golden, 2 to 2 1/2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve the pancakes immediately. Or transfer them to a platter, cover, and keep warm in a 200&deg;F oven. Enjoy with butter and maple syrup.</li>
        </ol>
